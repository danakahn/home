### Current Projects

**Spatially Mapping Methane Cycle Processes in Northern Forests** (June 2023 - Present)

* Conduct field work in [Howland Research Forest](https://www.woodwellclimate.org/project/methane-cycling-in-northern-forests/year-1/), a sub-boreal forest in central Maine. Collected soil samples for microbial and biogeochemical analyses

* Analyze gravimetric soil moisture, Total Carbon and Total Nitrogen, Microbial Biomass with Chloroform Fumigation Technique and Soil pH
